        <h1>About Me: Jeffery Solis</h1>
        <p> I'm a Mechanical Engineering graduate from the University of Georgia with a passion for practical design,
            sustainable systems, and continuous improvement. My academic and professional background includes experience
            in
            civil engineering internships, mechanical systems design, and hands-on construction and renovation projects
            throughout Athens, GA. I bring a working knowledge of drafting and modeling tools such as AutoCAD, Revit,
            and
            Civil 3D, and I've complemented my engineering skills with programming knowledge.
        <p>


        <p> I strongly value constant growth—whether through learning new tools, taking on unfamiliar challenges, or
            collaborating across disciplines. At the same time, I place high importance on stability and loyalty, both
            in
            the teams I work with and in the long-term goals I set for myself and my career. My aim is to contribute to
            impactful engineering solutions with consistency, adaptability, and integrity.
        <p>

        <p> To further showcase my growth and capabilities, I’ve built this website from scratch to serve as a portfolio
            for
            my engineering projects, designs, and other professional work.</p>

    <div class="second-body">
        <p>During my time at the University of Georgia, I completed a Bachelor of Science in Mechanical Engineering,
            engaging in a curriculum designed to build both technical expertise and problem-solving abilities. My
            coursework spanned fundamental sciences, core engineering principles, and advanced design topics, including:
        </p>
        <p>Thermodynamics & Heat Transfer – Gained a deep understanding of energy systems, efficiency analysis, and
            thermal
            management strategies used in mechanical and HVAC design.</p>

        <p>Fluid Mechanics & Hydraulics – Learned to analyze fluid behavior in systems, enabling applications in piping,
            pump design, and water system engineering.</p>

        <p>Engineering Mechanics (Statics & Dynamics) – Developed a solid foundation in force analysis, motion, and
            structural stability for mechanical and structural systems.</p>

        <p>Materials Science – Studied the properties, selection, and processing of materials, critical for product
            design
            and manufacturing decisions.</p>

        <p>Mechanical Design & CAD Modeling – Applied design principles using tools such as AutoCAD to create accurate
            technical drawings and prototypes.</p>

        <p>Manufacturing and Design – Learned about fabrication techniques, CNC machining, additive manufacturing, and
            quality control principles.</p>

        <p>Capstone Design Project – Led a sustainable water system project in partnership with Terrapin Beer Company,
            integrating teamwork, engineering design, and project management.</p>

        <p>Through these courses, I built skills in problem-solving, technical communication, data analysis, and
            cross-disciplinary collaboration. My experience prepared me to approach engineering challenges with a
            balance of
            creativity, analytical thinking, and practical application.</p>
