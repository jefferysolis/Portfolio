        <h2>Blender Donut Tutorial</h2>
        <p>I completed the full “Beginner Blender Tutorial – Donut Tutorial” by Blender Guru, covering the complete
            workflow of 3D modeling—from initial object creation to final rendering—using Blender’s modeling, texturing,
            lighting, and rendering tools.You will find the final product bellow, there is a still image rendered with
            300 samples. The video animation
            was also made with Blender. The quality isn't to the same degree, it was rendered at around 40 samples per
            frame for a total of 160 frames. Quality was sacrificed for time, rendering 160 frames at 300 samples would
            take 7 hours, which wasn't an option for me.</p>

        </video>
        <p>Skills Learned:</p>
        <p>3D Modeling: Mesh creation, extrusion, scaling, subdivision</p>
        <p>Texturing & Materials: Applying colors, textures, and surface properties</p>
        <p>Lighting Setup: Positioning light sources for realistic rendering</p>
        <p>Camera Setup: Framing and adjusting views for final renders</p>
        <p>Rendering: Using Cycles and Eevee for high-quality output</p>
        <p>Workflow Management: Layer organization, iterative refinement, and project structure</p>
        <p>Visual Presentation: Creating polished, realistic models for technical and creative projects</p>
        <h2>Solid Edge Tutorials</h2>
        <p>I followed a series of Solid Edge tutorials that demonstrated the modeling and assembly of three mechanical
            designs: a bushed-pin flanged coupling, a belt support, and a C-clamp. Each video walked through the
            step-by-step process of creating and assembling these components into complete mechanical systems. This
            served as a good introduction to Solid Edge, showing both how to use the software and most of the tools
            within it. The draft image is meant to show the capacity of Solid Edge, rather than a professional draft
            image, hence the overcrowding.

                Drawings and Assemblies</a></p>
        <p>Skills Learned:</p>
        <p>3D CAD Assembly Modeling : inserting and organizing multiple parts into complete assemblies</p>
        <p>Constraint Application (Mates, Alignments, Fits) : ensuring accurate positioning and interaction between
            components</p>
        <p>Parametric Design Adjustments : modifying part dimensions while maintaining assembly relationships</p>
        <p>Exploded Views & Visualization : presenting assemblies in clear, step-by-step breakdowns (especially in the
            C-Clamp tutorial)</p>
        <p>Mechanical Interpretation : understanding how individual parts (pins, flanges, belts, clamps) work together
            within a functional system</p>
        <p>Documentation & Presentation : preparing assemblies for communication, demonstration, or engineering review
        </p>
        <h2>Bonsai in Blender Project</h2>
        <p>I completed a playlist of Bonsai Blender tutorials. Bonsai is an add-on for Blender that enables full
            Building Information Modeling (BIM) workflows, using Industry Foundation Classes standard. While it isn't at
            the level of other CAD software, specifically Autodesk products, it is free and open-source which allows for
            a great base for learning about BIM and general CAD functions. It also gives allows for a plethora of
            options for visualization with the Blender functions.</p>
        <img src="assets/Bonsai.png" class="Bonsai">
        <p>Skills Learned:</p>
        <p>3D Modeling Fundamentals : building and refining digital objects with accuracy</p>
        <p>2D Drafting Techniques : creating technical floor plans and layouts from 3D models</p>
        <p>Section & Elevation Generation : producing orthographic views to understand structural and spatial
            relationships</p>
        <p>3D Detail Drawing Production : adding precision to components for clarity in construction or manufacturing</p>
        <p>Design Documentation Workflow : moving seamlessly from concept to technical deliverables</p>
        <p>Spatial & Structural Awareness : visualizing how parts and systems interact within a design</p>
        <p>Precision & Accuracy in Drafting : ensuring clarity and usability of drawings for engineering or construction
            teams</p>
        <p></p>
        <h2>FreeCAD Modeling</h2>
        <p>I completed various video tutorials, using an open source CAD software called FreeCAD. This collection of
            tutorials focuses on applying FreeCAD’s BIM workbench to real-world architectural and mechanical system
            modeling. The videos guide viewers through creating a complete building model—beginning with architectural
            elements like slabs, walls, and roofs—before progressing into the design of drainage piping systems and HVAC
            duct assemblies. Each tutorial showcases how FreeCAD can be used to model and integrate multiple building
            systems within a single coordinated BIM environment.

            These tutorials highlight the connection between structural and mechanical design, demonstrating how
            different systems interact within a digital building model. The process mirrors real-world engineering
            workflows, emphasizing the coordination between architectural design, plumbing layout, and HVAC
            planning—skills that are essential for multidisciplinary engineering collaboration and technical precision.
